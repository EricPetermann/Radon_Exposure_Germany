This is supporting material to our study "Development of a High-Resolution Indoor Radon Map Using a New Machine Learning-Based Probabilistic Model and German Radon Survey Data". Here you can find interactive maps of spatial distribution of indoor radon concentration, an radioactive carcinogenic gas, in the German population. Further, you can also find our model as an interactive tool to get a feeling of what is going on behind the scenes.
