title: "Indoor radon concentration in Germany"
---

This is supporting material to our recent preprint "Exploring a new machine learning based probabilistic model for high-resolution indoor radon mapping, using the German indoor radon survey data". Here you can find interactive maps of exposure of the German population to the carcinogen radioactive gas radon. Further, you can also find our model as an interactive tool to get a feeling of what is going on behind the scenes.
